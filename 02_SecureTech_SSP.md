## 3. Control Families


## 3.1 Access Control (AC)

- **AC-1: Access Control Policy and Procedures**  
  SecureTech maintains documented access control policies that define user roles and responsibilities. Policies are reviewed annually, but some departments have not acknowledged or adopted the latest version.

- **AC-2: Account Management**
  - User accounts are managed via Azure Active Directory with automated provisioning and deactivation workflows. However, some terminated accounts were found to remain active beyond 30 days.

- **AC-3: Access Enforcement**  
  Role-based access controls (RBAC) are enforced across all systems, including SharePoint and internal servers.

- **AC-4: Information Flow Enforcement**  
  Firewall rules and VLAN segmentation restrict data flow between departments.

---

## 3.2 Awareness and Training (AT)

- **AT-1: Security Awareness Training Policy**  
  All employees receive once every ten years cybersecurity awareness training, although the policy states training should occur annually.

- **AT-2: Role-Based Training**  
  System administrators and developers don't have specialized training on secure system configuration and coding practices, despite being listed as a requirement in the internal training policy.

---

## 3.3 Audit and Accountability (AU)

- **AU-1: Audit Policy and Procedures**  
  Audit policies are documented and reviewed quarterly, but recent audits revealed that some systems were not included in the review scope.

- **AU-2: Event Logging**  
  Security events are logged using Splunk Cloud and retained for 12 months. However, logs from mobile devices are not consistently captured.

- **AU-3: Content of Audit Records**  
  Logs include timestamps, user IDs, event types, and source IP addresses.

---

## 3.4 Configuration Management (CM)

- **CM-1: Configuration Management Policy**  
  SecureTech maintains a baseline configuration for all systems, but enforcement of these baselines is inconsistent across departments.

- **CM-2: Configuration Change Control**  
  Changes are tracked via Jira and require approval before deployment. However, emergency changes are sometimes implemented without formal documentation.
