# SecureTech SSP Assessment Simulation

## 🛡️ Project Overview

This repository contains a **partial simulation** of a NIST SP 800-171 System Security Plan (SSP) assessment for a fictional organization, **SecureTech Solutions**. The simulation focuses on three control families:

- **Access Control (AC)**
- **Awareness and Training (AT)**
- **Audit and Accountability (AU)**

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to document, assess, and track compliance with selected NIST SP 800-171 controls in a structured and professional format.

## 📦 Included Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `02_SecureTech_SSP_Template.md` | The fictional System Security Plan (SSP) describing the environment and implementation of selected controls |
| `03_Assessment_Score_Sheet.xlsx` | A scoring sheet evaluating the implementation status of AC, AT, and AU controls |
| `04_POAM.md` | Plan of Action and Milestones for partially or non-implemented controls |
| `05_Final_Report.md` | Final summary report of the assessment findings and recommendations |

## 📌 Scope

This simulation covers only a **subset** of the 14 NIST SP 800-171 control families. The following families are included:

- ✅ Access Control (AC)
- ✅ Awareness and Training (AT)
- ✅ Audit and Accountability (AU)

All other control families are **outside the scope** of this simulation.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Review the `02_SecureTech_SSP_Template.md` to understand the fictional system and control implementations.
2. Open the `03_Assessment_Score_Sheet.xlsx` to view the scoring of each control.
3. Examine the `04_POAM.md` to see how gaps are tracked and remediated.
4. Read the `05_Final_Report.md` for a summary of findings and next steps.
